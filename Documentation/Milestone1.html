<h3>Project Focus (New Project)</h3>
<p>Our focus for the new project is to create a login system which will separate user views based on assigned user privileges: employees and administrators. We will implement
the necessary code to allow users to easily access their employee information, as well as an intuitive administrator section. We will also create new tables within our WP database to store
user login information.</p>

<p><b>Information Topics: (New Project)</b></p>
<p> &#8226; Nature of Information and Knowledge</p>
<p> &#8226; Role of Information Systems</p>
<p> &#8226; Information Architectures</p>
<p> &#8226; I.T. Policy and Law</p>
<p><b>Unifying Theme: (New Project)</b></p>
<p>Databases are a collection of raw data which is given meaning, the collection of meaningful data becomes valuable information which can be utilized for present and future applications in the form of human knowledge. 
Information system's role is to use this information most efficiently by supporting the critical aspects of running an organization, namely with communication, record-keeping, and data analysis by providing more efficient and 
accessible methods of collecting, transferring, and manipulating data with the heavy use of automated technology. These method's ideologies are established under the study of information architectures that involved solving the 
fundamental problems of accessing and using the vast amounts of information available to a company.<br><br>
Given that information architecture establishes the best methods of dealing with the information, the role of information 
systems utilizes those methods within the technological system, all while dealing with the interpretation of data; I.T. Policy and Law directly affects how the data must be handled within those categories by emphasizing the importance of encrypting 
sensitive data, protecting web form inputs from SQL injection, and general practices for physical and network security.</p>
